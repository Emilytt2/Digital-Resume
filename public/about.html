<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>

<p>Hello, world! I am Emily, a budding web developer with a passion for problem solving. 
   A singer by education, a finance professional by trade, and a poler by hobby, I am someone
   with many interests and loves. (Learn more about them <a href="./hobbies.html">here</a>!) My newest mission is to learn how to code. I've been considering
   learning this skill for years, but since starting my current job, I have learned how to use VBA to automate
   all kinds of tasks. I am quickly learning that there is no problem I can't solve with the right tools.
</p>

<p>Since learning VBA, I've been more interested in doing this kind of work at my job than 
  I have been in doing actual portfolio administration work. Although I am grateful for all I 
  know thanks to my years in finance, I am ready to embark on a new mission. I maintain my 
  current job in the finance sector and study programming in the evenings, but I'm ready
  to take the plunge to full time as soon as someone is ready for me. 
</p>

<p>If you are excited to work with an up-and-coming developer who has the drive to learn and use 
  newfound skills to solve increasingly complex problems, look no further! I would love to <a href="./contact.html">hear 
  from you</a> about any opportunities to embark on my next career journey.
