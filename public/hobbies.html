                I started singing as soon as I started speaking, and I haven't stopped.
                I joined my first choir at age eleven, I pursued my bachelor's 
                degree in music from Capital University as a young woman, and I now serve as 
                the soprano section leader at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Oakwood.

                I began poling one weekend after my wedding two years ago,
                and I am in love! I have never been more confident, more willing
                to take risks, or more physically strong. I owe so much of the woman
                I am today to the woman who took the plunge to try a new 
                (more fun) exercise program!

                Something you may not know about me is that I have a condition
                called aphantasia, which means I can't picture things in my head. 
                I think that's why theme parks capture me the way they do. I love 
                stepping into an alternate land of imagination so that I can see 
                what everyone else can if they just close their eyes. Of course, 
                I do enjoy a good ride, but it's the fully immersive experiences 
                that draw me in and capture my heart.

                Maybe it's cheating to say that my "interest" is my family,
                but that doesn't make it any less true. I really have
                saved the best for last. Whether it's spending the 
                day being silly with my nieces, taking my sister to Ulta, 
                visiting my Dad and family in Boston, Sunday lunch with my mom, or just 
                spending a lazy day with my husband Chris, it's always
                time well spent.
